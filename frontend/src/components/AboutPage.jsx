                    I usually browse lists of movies such as{' '}

                    . Other than going to each specific website, IMDB and Letterboxd are two popular places
                    to browse for such movie lists which are created and shared by users. However, all of
                    these websites have at least one of the following limitations:
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The list does not display enough information such as genre, synopsis, director
                            and actors about each movie so that user can take a quick look without having to
                            go to each movie's own web page.
                        </li>
                        <li>The list does not have continuous scrolling.</li>
                    </ul>
                    So I created this website to have all the movie lists I care about in one place, and to
                    have the above limitations addressed.
